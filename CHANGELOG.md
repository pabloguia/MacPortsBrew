# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Two version numbers matter and they move independently:

- the **tool version**, which follows semantic versioning; and
- the **policy version**, the identifier stamped on every recommendation and
  carried in every `--json` payload. Its format is
  `<newest read_on across data/policy/>-<serial within that day>`
  (`data/policy/policy.toml`). Dated facts about Homebrew and MacPorts live in
  that directory, so a change to what the tool believes about a provider moves
  the policy version without necessarily moving the tool version.

The `--json` output is a compatibility surface: each payload carries a
`schemaVersion`, and changing a schema incompatibly requires a version bump and
an entry in [`docs/spec-evolution.md`](docs/spec-evolution.md). Human-readable
output may change freely.

## [Unreleased]

The read-only slice. Nothing here executes anything, elevates anything, or
writes into either provider's prefix.

**Policy version: `2026.09.02-1`.** The provider facts it carries were read on
2026-09-02 and are dated in `data/policy/*.toml`; the staleness threshold is
180 days, after which the CLI says the data may be out of date without refusing
to answer.

### Added

- **Domain layer** (`crates/domain`): provider-neutral types for packages,
  ownership, package classes, artifact availability, mappings, resolutions,
  support state, snapshots, migration plans and the error taxonomy. No I/O, no
  clock, no provider name in any signature.
- **Policy engine** (`crates/policy`): named, individually testable rules
  evaluated in identifier order with priority-based resolution and identifier
  tie-breaks. `MANUAL_REVIEW` cannot be outvoted. No rule names a
  provider; everything a rule knows about one comes from `data/policy/*.toml`
  with a source and a read date.
- **Application layer** (`crates/application`): capture, analysis,
  classification, mapping, planning, explanation and `doctor`. Analysis is a
  pure function of a snapshot and the policy data, so `--from-snapshot` runs
  the same code as a live run.
- **Adapters** (`crates/adapters`): read-only Homebrew and MacPorts adapters
  over a single process executor, a provider registry, snapshot persistence and
  machine/`PATH` inspection. The only layer that touches the machine.
- **CLI** (`crates/cli`): `status`, `analyze`, `list`, `explain`, `plan`,
  `doctor` and `snapshot`, each with `--json`; the English message catalogue,
  the pseudolocale (`--language qps`), and a display-width-aware table
  renderer.
- **Commands and aliases**: `macportsbrew` and `mpb` from one binary.
- **Versioned JSON schemas** documented in
  [`docs/schemas/`](docs/schemas/README.md), all at `schemaVersion` 1.
- **Fixture replay and the golden matrix**: `--replay <recording>` (a hidden
  testing flag, like `--today`) runs the whole program against a captured
  recording; `scripts/capture-fixture.sh`
  produces one; `scripts/run-fixture-matrix.sh` runs the read slice over every
  recording and compares the analysis byte for byte against
  `fixtures/golden/`, with `--update` to regenerate. The shipped recordings
  cover Homebrew only, MacPorts only, both, neither, a broken provider, and a
  deprecated formula with a third-party tap, across Intel and Apple Silicon and
  across older and current macOS.
- **Policy data** in `data/policy/`: curated mappings, provider support states,
  bottle tags, provider commands and elevation, runtime managers and stateful
  package families — every entry with its `source` and `read_on`.
- **Validation**: `scripts/validate.sh` in three modes, plus layering, SPDX,
  dependency-licence, i18n-parity, coverage and deployment-target checks.
- **Documentation**: `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` with six contributor
  recipes, `SECURITY.md`, the `wiki/` page set, `docs/schemas/`, issue and pull
  request templates, and six contributor skills under `.claude/skills/`
  written from the same source as the recipes.

### Not yet implemented

Named here because a changelog that lists only what exists invites the reader
to assume the rest does: `migrate`, `restore --run`, `primary`,
`provider-priority`, `providers`, `env`, `history`, `cleanup`, the interactive
TUI, `doctor --deep`, the cache and its TTL, and translations for `pt-BR`,
`es`, `ja` and `zh-CN` — the i18n architecture and the complete English
catalogue are in place, the translations are not.

### Known limitations

- `--no-network`, `--refresh`, `--dry-run` and `--yes` are accepted and are
  no-ops in a build that never uses the network, never caches, is always a dry
  run and never prompts. They exist so scripts written now keep working.
- `Catalogue::for_locale` returns the English catalogue for every tag except
  the pseudolocale, so `--language pt-BR` selects the locale's plural rules and
  layout while the text stays English.
- Branch-coverage floors are not enforced: `cargo-llvm-cov --branch` needs a
  nightly toolchain and the pinned toolchain is stable
  ([ADR-0002](docs/adr/0002-implementation-language.md)).
- There is no published release. Release signing is
  [DP-004](docs/decisions-pending.md) and the repository has no remote
  ([DP-007](docs/decisions-pending.md)).
